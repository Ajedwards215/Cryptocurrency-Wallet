#Blockchain-Python

This project involved integrating the Ethereum blockchain network into Fintech Finder, a platform that enables customers to find and pay fintech professionals. Users can calculate the total value of an Ethereum transaction, sign and send a transaction to the Ganache blockchain, and review the transaction hash code associated with the validated blockchain transaction. 

Integrating the crypto_wallet.py script containing the Ethereum transaction functions into the fintech_finder.py script, which contains the code associated with the application's web interface. The completed project enables Fintech Finder customers to generate a new Ethereum account instance and fetch and display the account balance associated with their Ethereum account address.
